    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hi there, I am B.V.K Ratnesh, an aspiring Web Developer and Python enthusiast.
        I am currently studying Computer Science Engineering in CMR Institute Of Technology 
        in Hyderabad. I have been a Tech enthusiast throughout my childhood.

        curiosity shifted towards the backend of it which includes HOW the Technology 
        works which paved the path for my Coding Journey. Currently, I am learning
        different programming languages and getting used to different libraries.
        <br>Currently I am learning Web Development, with the help of which I was able
        to build this website.
